# JournalZ - A Note Taking Application

# Overview

A simple online journal application that lets the user log daily journal entries. Each day, the application will open with a blank journal page on which a user can record daily events, thoughts, or anything that comes to mind. At the end of the day, the application stores the dated journal entry for the day and refreshes the page with a new blank journal. Users can review any previous journal entries and edit or delete them.

# Application Initialization

To use this application you should have `node` and `npm` installed and issue the following commands:

1. `npm install`: this will install the required `node` libraries.
2. `npm run watch`: this will compile the application code and produce an `App.js` file in the `static` directory. This command will also continue to run until explicitly killed (e.g., control-C).
3. `npm start`: this will run the Express server, `server.js`, allowing you to view the running application in the browser window.
